# Python Basics
What is python?
Python is an interpreted high-level general purpose programing language.
Python is multi platform and can used for a wide variety of purposes to include scripting, 
AI and machine learning, data analytics, programming applications, and web development just to name a few.
Over the next couple of weeks we will be using python to build out a script collaboratively, 
that will be used for host discovery. Namely to identify active IP addresses on a network and associate a host
name with the IP and save them in .xml format. Throughout this exercise we will build upon concepts from the previous
week till we have completed the script, we will then explore different ways we can code the script in order to accomplish 
the same goal.

Starting out

Starting out we will need an enviroment to write our code in. I personally recomend
Microsoft's VS Code. It is an excellent editor that is highly customizable with the 
use of extensions to get it just the way you want it
After we have selected our editor of choice we will make a new file and we can finally begin 
coding.  

Covering the basics

When you start a new project it is always best practice to put what language you are 
using at the top of the file either in a comment, or a #! line to identify what 
language the terminal will use to interpret the file for when we have completed our script

a #! line will look as follows

{
#!/usr/bin/env/python
}
^^^ This will be the first line of code for our script
after this we can begin coding in earnest.
//NOTE the #! line can vary depending on where python is installed on your system however on most systems with the default install it will look something like this.

Librarys

What is a python library?
Python libraries are a set of usefull functions that eliminate the need for writing 
all the code out by hand and will signifantly streamline the coding process. 
Python has an extensible set of libraries both community and otherwise available for it.

for more information on libraries and what is availible to you please visit
https://docs.python.org/3/

in order to make use of libraries it will look this

{
#!/usr/bin/env/python
include subprocess
}

Subprocess is a library for python thay will allow the coder to use system commands available in the terminal in the python script itself. This 
can be extreamly helpfull especially if we are developing a script.

Now that we have been introduced to python and understand how to start lets jump over to our code example macChanger.py and take a look through it and break it
down before we begin coding ourselves.
